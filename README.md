# Components

A library of ML components for faster experiments, research, blogposts, competitions and fun.


## Models

Create various neural networks from different components. See the [`components/models`](/components) folder.

- MobileNet v1, v2, v3
- ResNet, XResNet
- SENet
- EfficientNet

## Datasets

For faster loading of various data sources. See the `components/datasets` folder.

## Training

Easily train models using [PyTorch Lightning]() or a vanilla training script. Includes grid search functionality, easy configuration, telemetry and logging. See `components/lightning`.
